# Face Recognition Model

A custom face recognition model built from scratch using Python, OpenCV, Pillow, Face, and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) for accurate facial recognition and identification.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascades for detecting faces in images and video.
- **Face Recognition**: Implements LBPH for extracting facial features and recognizing individuals.
- **Image Processing**: Uses Pillow and OpenCV for image preprocessing, resizing, and format conversion.
